# 🧾 Credit EDA Project

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a credit dataset to uncover patterns and insights related to credit risk. It includes cleaning, visualization, and transformation of data to prepare for future modeling like credit scoring or loan approval prediction.

## 📌 Objective

To analyze customer financial data and understand the key factors that affect **loan defaults** using Python libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

## 🧪 Key Features

- Data Cleaning (missing values, duplicates)
- Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate Analysis
- Visualizations using histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, scatter plots
- Correlation and distribution analysis
- Data Transformation (Log Transform, Scaling)

✅ Conclusion
This EDA helps identify:

Key drivers of credit default (e.g., low income, high loan amount)

Data quality issues (missing or skewed data)

The best features to use for predictive modeling
